 // Multi Tenant Connections
// In the context of Mongoose, a multi-tenant architecture typically means a case where multiple 
// different clients talk to MongoDB through a single Mongoose application. 
// This typically means each client makes queries and executes updates through a single 
// Mongoose application, but has a distinct MongoDB database within the same MongoDB cluster.

// Maintain one connection pool, switch between tenants using the Connection.prototype.useDb() method.
// Maintain a separate connection pool per tenant, store connections in a map or POJO.

//   Connection Pools
// Each connection, whether created with mongoose.connect or mongoose.createConnection are all backed by
//  an internal configurable connection pool defaulting to a maximum size of 100. 

// minPoolSize - The minimum number of sockets the MongoDB driver will keep open for this connection. The MongoDB driver may close sockets that have been inactive for some time. You may want to increase minPoolSize if
    
//  you expect your app to go through long idle times and want to make sure your sockets stay open to avoid slow trains when activity picks up.

    // To get faster feedback on failed connections, 
    // you can reduce serverSelectionTimeoutMS to 5000 as follows.
    //  We don't recommend reducing serverSelectionTimeoutMS unless you are running a standalone MongoDB
    //  server rather than a replica set, or unless you are using a serverless runtime like AWS Lambda.
